/*
 * __schedule() is the main scheduler function.
 *
 * The main means of driving the scheduler and thus entering this function are:
 *
 *   1. Explicit blocking: mutex, semaphore, waitqueue, etc.
 *
 *   2. TIF_NEED_RESCHED flag is checked on interrupt and userspace return
 *      paths. For example, see arch/x86/entry_64.S.
 *
 *      To drive preemption between tasks, the scheduler sets the flag in timer
 *      interrupt handler scheduler_tick().
 *
 *   3. Wakeups don't really cause entry into schedule(). They add a
 *      task to the run-queue and that's it.
 *
 *      Now, if the new task added to the run-queue preempts the current
 *      task, then the wakeup sets TIF_NEED_RESCHED and schedule() gets
 *      called on the nearest possible occasion:
 *
 *       - If the kernel is preemptible (CONFIG_PREEMPT=y):
 *
 *         - in syscall or exception context, at the next outmost
 *           preempt_enable(). (this might be as soon as the wake_up()'s
 *           spin_unlock()!)
 *
 *         - in IRQ context, return from interrupt-handler to
 *           preemptible context
 *
 *       - If the kernel is not preemptible (CONFIG_PREEMPT is not set)
 *         then at the next:
 *
 *          - cond_resched() call
 *          - explicit schedule() call
 *          - return from syscall or exception to user-space
 *          - return from interrupt-handler to user-space
 *
 * WARNING: must be called with preemption disabled!
